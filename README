# Roman to Hindu-Arabic number conversion

Roman numerals are I, V, X, L, C, D, and M. They correspond to the common (Hindu-Arabic) numbers 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000, respectively.
Roman numbers are written using these numerals; and are additive in all cases *except* when I precedes V, X precedes L or C, and C precedes D or M.
In these cases, the smaller Roman number is *subtracted* from the former, viz:
IV = 4
XL = 40
XC = 90
CD = 400
CM = 900

This monorepo contains a few TDD'd samples of Roman to Hindu-Arabic conversions. The purpose is illustrative: how TDD aids in simple design and refactoring.

It's instructive to examine not just the final solution but each individual commit.
